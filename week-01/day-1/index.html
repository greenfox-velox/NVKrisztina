        <p><h2>Welcome to the CV of Little Mermaid.</h2></p>
        <p><h3>The Little Mermaid dwells in an underwater kingdom with
          her father (the sea king or mer-king), her dowager grandmother,
          and her five older sisters, each of whom had been born one year
          apart. When a mermaid turns 15, she is permitted to swim to the
          surface for the first time to glimpse the world above, and when
          the sisters become old enough, each of them visits the upper world
          one at a time every year. As each returns, the Little Mermaid
          listens longingly to their
          various descriptions of the world inhabited by human beings...</h3></p>
